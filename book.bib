  abstract = {At least 300 Mio t of plastic are produced annually, from which large parts end up in the environment, where it persists over decades, harms biota and enters the food chain. Yet, almost nothing is known about plastic pollution of soil; hence, the aims of this work are to review current knowledge on i) available methods for the quantification and identification of plastic in soil, ii) the quantity and possible input pathways of plastic into soil, (including first preliminary screening of plastic in compost), and iii) its fate in soil. Methods for plastic analyses in sediments can potentially be adjusted for application to soil; yet, the applicability of these methods for soil needs to be tested. Consequently, the current data base on soil pollution with plastic is still poor. Soils may receive plastic inputs via plastic mulching or the application of plastic containing soil amendments. In compost up to 2.38\textendash 1200 mg plastic kg-1 have been found so far; the plastic concentration of sewage sludge varies between 1000 and 24,000 plastic items kg-1. Also irrigation with untreated and treated wastewater (1000\textendash 627,000 and 0\textendash 125,000 plastic items m-3, respectively) as well as flooding with lake water (0.82\textendash 4.42 plastic items m-3) or river water (0\textendash 13,751 items km-2) can provide major input pathways for plastic into soil. Additional sources comprise littering along roads and trails, illegal waste dumping, road runoff as well as atmospheric input. With these input pathways, plastic concentrations in soil might reach the per mill range of soil organic carbon. Most of plastic (especially N 1 {$\mu$}m) will presumably be retained in soil, where it persists for decades or longer. Accordingly, further research on the prevalence and fate of such synthetic polymers in soils is urgently warranted.},

  abstract = {Soils have been shown to be a major sink for plastic that is released to the environment. Several agricultural practices have been identified that can result in large plastic flows onto soils, among them the use of plastic-polluted compost and digestate. However, the magnitude of this flow is currently still unclear. The aim of this work was to quantify the flows of plastic with compost and digestate onto soils based on data from Switzerland using material flow analysis (MFA). Input data to the model were based on published data on organic waste management and plastic content in compost. In order to quantify the plastic in the biomass input, measurements were made at an anaerobic digestion plant. Together with published data on the plastic content in compost, the full fate of plastic in organic waste in Switzerland could be obtained from 1985 to 2017. 6,300 t year-1 of plastic enter the system together with organic waste, and 6,200 t year-1 are removed and are incinerated. 34.5 {$\pm$} 7.1 t year-1 are contained in the solid digestate, 50 {$\pm$} 11 t year-1 in compost, 12.4 {$\pm$} 3 t year-1 in windrow compost and 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 t year-1 in solid digestate from codigestion. Overall, 71 {$\pm$} 11 t year-1 of plastic are transferred to agricultural soil, 22.4 {$\pm$} 3.3 t year-1 to horticulture and 3.6 {$\pm$} 0.7 t year-1 to private consumers. Using dynamic MFA, we predict that 1,390 {$\pm$} 390 tonnes of plastic have accumulated in Swiss soils through compost addition since 1985. These values can serve as basis for evaluating the contribution of composting to the plastic pollution in soils.},
