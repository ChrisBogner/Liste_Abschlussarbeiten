## CRC 1357 Microplastics

### Vertical distribution of microplastic particles in alluvial soils

**Description**: You will determine the amount of microplastic particles on soil samples taken in different depths in s profile in Merkenich-Langel (Cologne).

**Goal**: Visualize the vertical distribution of MPs and correlate them to soil properties to understand possible vertical migration of particles.

**Methods**: $\mu$-FTIR spectroscopy

**Contact**: Hannes Laermanns, Markus Rolf

**Particularities**: Lab work partially to be done at the University of Bayreuth (Dr. M. LÃ¶der)
